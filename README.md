Miwok App
===================================

This is my version of the Miwok app, used in the Udacity course 'Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps'.

The course introduces the concepts of Activity Lifecycle, Implicit and Explicit Intents, Up Navigation, Event Listeners, ListView + ArrayAdapter, MediaPlayer + AudioFocus, Ripple Effect, Fragments, ViewPager + TabLayout.
